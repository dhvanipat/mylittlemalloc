*delete this before submitting*

to be implemented:
- test files
    - come up with 1 more stress test for memgrind
- last: project README



questions:
- malloc(0) returns null or a pointer?
- is it ok to use unsigned int instead of size_t for size?
- i did the timing for memgrind slightly differently using cpu time instead of wall clock time is this ok
- do we put the executables in the final tar submission?
- coalesce: are we graded on time complexity?
