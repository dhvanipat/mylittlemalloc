to be implemented:
- mymalloc.c
- mymalloc.h
- memgrind.c
- test files
    - what is a Make-file
- last: project README


edge cases:
- what if you had a chunk that allocated all but 8 bytes of memory
    - big enough for a header but you can't store anything there
        - solution: allocate it as a chunk w ith size 0
    - we should figure out how malloc behaves if you ask for a free chunk of 0 bytes
