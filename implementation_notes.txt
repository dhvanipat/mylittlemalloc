to be implemented:
- memgrind.c
- test files
- last: project README


edge cases:
- what if you had a chunk that allocated all but 8 bytes of memory
    - big enough for a header but you can't store anything there
        - solution: allocate it as a chunk w ith size 0
    - real malloc still returns a pointer for 0 bytes
        - but we should confirm this in the writeup or with an instructor
    - make sure free works as planned on a freshly initiated chunk of memory where there is one chunk of size 0



free
1. valid address?
go through start, iterate through all chunks, find a match
if match, free
if not, illegalpointerexception
coalesce


coalesce
1. check if there is chunk in front AND there is chunk behind
2. check if they are allocated
if either is free merge the chunks

tests:
come up with 2 more stress tests

idea:
1 for coalesce
 coalesce all from before
 coalesce all from after
 coalesce both
